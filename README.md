# 📌 Prompt Manager - Organizing Prompts, Models, and Artifacts Across AI Workflows

Welcome to **Prompt Manager**, a centralized AI-powered tool developed by the [LATAI Community](https://github.com/LATAI-Community) for managing the **prompts**, **versions**, **Ai model outputs**, and **software artifacts** generated across diverse AI systems and versions we are building within this community.

> 🧠 **Built by AI, for AI learners.**

## 🌎 What Is Prompt Manager?

In the LATAI community, we develop software using **AI assistance or VibeCoding**—which means we generate code, documentation, test cases, and entire software modules via **prompting different AI models**.

However, as our prompt sets evolve over time and span across:
- Multiple **AI vendors** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Grok),
- Different **model versions** (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude 2, Claude Opus, DeepSeek R1, etc.),
- And diverse **programming languages and artifact types** (Python, Java, Markdown, SQL, etc.),

...we needed to have a system to **track, relate, version, and compare** these prompts and the AI-generated artifacts they produced more beautiful than hundreds or thousands of files floting around the project (across with the artifacts).

**Prompt Manager** is that system we need to have to make our Ai learning smoothly.

It helps us:
- 📂 **Organize prompts** by project, purpose, and usage.
- 🧬 **Track version history** of each prompt and compare improvements over time.
- 🤖 **Associate prompts with the models used** and the specific AI vendors.
- 🧪 **Store and relate generated outputs** like code files, test cases, documentation, and more.
- 🔍 **Compare prompt effectiveness** across different models and contexts.

## 🚀 Why Use Prompt Manager?

Because in a community that learns **AI through AI**, we don’t just write prompts — we analyze them, evolve them, and compare how they perform across models. Prompt Manager gives us the power to:

- Build reusable **prompt templates**.
- Record **prompt-to-output** relationships.
- Compare results across **AI vendors and models**.
- Enable **traceability** for generated artifacts in software projects.
- Improve prompt quality iteratively over time.

It’s like Git for prompts — but model-aware, an in fact we will be using the GIT capabilities with the facility of TXT files to have a simple but powerful way for our members to check the Ai models and progress of each.
